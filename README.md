## Overview

PORTUNO is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) developed to assist in classroom management and access permissions. The system is designed to meet the needs of teachers, allowing them to occupy and release classrooms, as well as manage access permissions for the rooms they are responsible for. Additionally, it provides functionalities for common users such as login and logout.

The system also includes administrative features such as user registration, user deletion, semester registration, semester deletion, and more.

## Features

- Occupy Room: Teachers have the ability to reserve classrooms for use during specific time periods.
- Release Room: Teachers can release classrooms that are no longer in use, making them available to other users.
- Login: Users can log in to the system to access its features and resources.
- Logout: Users can log out of the system, ending their current session.

Additional features for teachers:
- Room Permissions: Teachers have special permissions to manage the rooms they are responsible for. They can assign access permissions to other users, controlling who can occupy and use those rooms.

Administrative features:
- User Registration: The administrator has the ability to register new users in the system.
- User Deletion: The administrator can remove users from the system, revoking their access and permissions.
- Semester Registration: The administrator can register semesters in the system, allowing organization and management of information according to academic periods.
- Semester Deletion: The administrator has the option to delete previously registered semesters.
